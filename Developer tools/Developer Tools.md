All the way back to the beginning of the web

- Situational Awareness
- Understanding how the page is built
- seeing what hosts it's talking to and what contents it's bringing in
- extracting useful info 
- changing the app's behaviour 
- Different browsers have similar tools

- [[console]]: whats going on
- inspector: how its put together
- Dom: top down view
- storage: little databases
- [[Network]]: all connections
- debugger: all problems

ALWAYS HAVE THE CONSOLE OPEN
