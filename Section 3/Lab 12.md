Make a review and see the request on BurpSuite. After that make an edit on that review and see what the difference is.

You see we get an ID of the review. 

we also see that when we post the review we get a PUT [[HTTP]] header and when we edit we get a PATCH

now all we have to do is make it so the id field is not equal to empty and pass that through on the repeater

```
{
"id": {
"$ne":""
},
"message":"insert the review here... WEHHHHHH"
}
```

We learnt this in [[NOSQL Injection]] boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii smort
