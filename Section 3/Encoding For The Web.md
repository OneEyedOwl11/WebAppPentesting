We use UTF-8 for the entire web

can't have slash in file name
	because those are directory separators
can't have space in [[URL's]]
	because it indicates end of url
can't have CR/LF in an [[HTTP]] header
	because that indicates "end of this header"
can't have angle brackets in [[HTML]]
	because that indicates tags in HTML
can't have null in middle of a C-style string
	because null means "end of string"
	operating systems don't read anything after a null byte because their terminals usually work in C

[[URL's]]-Encoding 
replace any "special character" with a percent symbol followed by the characters 2-digit hex code

space = %20
\# = %23
% = %25
& = %26
/ = %2f
: = %3a
= = %3d
. MAY become %2e
@ MAY become %40
null = %00
CR = %0d
LF = %0a
tab = %09
B MAY become %42

[[HTML]]-Encoding 

< becomes &lt;
\> becomes &gt;
" becomes &quot;
' becomes &apos;
& becomes &amp;

XMl is the same, there are only 5 "special characters"

you can replace a character with its UTF-8 code point 
using decimal A becomes &#65
using hexadecimal A becomes &#x41

be honest with yourself. You won't remember this so use CyberChef.

comma-separated values seems simple, just add commas
what if a value has a comma in it?
	Put quotes around the value
What if a value has quotes in it?
	Put an extra quote in front of each quote
First, Last, Nickname
William, "Brooks,Sr","""Buffalo"" Bill" 

A "Trusted System" is not the same as a "trustworthy" system
A "Trusted System" is one you've chosen not to defend yourself against
Should the back end "trust" what comes from the web server?
