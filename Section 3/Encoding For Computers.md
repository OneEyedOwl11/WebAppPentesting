Interpretation is what gives it meaning encoding determines interpretation

Encoding determines meaning

In [[HTTP]] the headers often tell you how to interpret the code. In the 
```Content-Type```: tag;

```X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff``` Usually means the sender does not want you to interpret the content in any other way. Usually browsers can interpret the content type even without being explicitly told, sometimes they do this even if told what the content is. No sniff prohibits the browser from doing so.

Letters:

01000001 = 101(octal) = 65(decimal) = 41(hex) = 'A' (ASCII) = garbage (EBCDIC)
11000001 10000001 = 0xC1 0x81 = 'Aa’ (EBCDIC) = 'A’ + garbage (ASCII) = 'Á' (UTF-8)
Top: ASCII and UTF-8

Middle: EBCDIC

Bottom: UTF-8 and ASCII
