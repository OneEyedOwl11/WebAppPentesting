Why does it work 
```
Input: $name = "Robert";

Query: 
		SELECT * FROM Students
		WHERE (grade=11 and name='$name')
Result:
		SELECT * FROM Students
		WHERE (grade=11 and name='Robert');
```

What actually happened

```
Input: $name = "Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--";

Query: 
		SELECT * FROM Students
		WHERE (grade=11 and name='$name')
Result:
		SELECT * FROM Students
		WHERE (grade=11 and name='Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--');
```

A query "succeeds" if it returns data, or returns true

"fails" if it returns no data "null" or if it returns "false"

True and False are boolean values

they have NOTHING to do with whether the query found any data

```
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE name = 'Bobby' or TRUE

-- returns all rows:
-- "anything OR TRUE" is TRUE 
```

```
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE name = 'Bobby' or FALSE

-- returns 0 rows:
-- "anything OR FALSE" is FALSE 
```

submit a string that contains "SQL special characters"
- double quotes
- single quotes
- backticks
Maybe an errors
more likely, a different response

- Hypothesize about what that query may look like
- type the query out so you can refer to it
- submit strings that would change the behavior if they worked
- ...repeat

- Use webapp vulnerability scanner
- sqlmap
