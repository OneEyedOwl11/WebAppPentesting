Header Has two main things
1. This is a JWT ([[JSON Web Tokens]])
2. The signature was computed with *this* algorithm

Payload may say a few standard

iss: issuer     sub:subject
	iat:issued at    exp:expires at
		nbf:"not before" (start date)

payload may say... literally anything else
	Username?
		email address?
			role?
				permissions?
					password?

signature is a digital signature of encoded header and payload, using the algorithm named in the header

Common Use: Federated (more than one thing using it) authentication (prove who you are) with local authorization (what are you allowed to do given who you are)

[[JSON]] can have newlines
[[HTTP]] headers can't

Most JWT's are JWS's (signatures)
	they are encoded, not encrypted. 
		therefore they are always readable

A good signature allows tampering to be detected
signing algorithm is part of the header
	therefore attacker-contollable... ALWAYS.

Servers need to be careful
More "bouncer" than "concierge"
Robustness Principle (be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others) is a nice theory though

BE AS STRICT AS POSSIBLE ABOUT TOKENS

1. Do not trust user input
2. Everything is user input
3. Devs: validate everything
4. Attackers: Attack everything

Most issues in OWASP Top 10 is from user input
