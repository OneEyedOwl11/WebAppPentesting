Privacy considerations

[[JSON Web Tokens]] may contain sensitive info
	Encrypt it or use TLS
	Omitting sensitive info is the best way

No Privacy protections in JWT's
	"none" algorithm disables signing completely, therefore disabling verification
		The "none" algorithm is... required? optional? ...both?

Attacks, then:
	1. information disclosure (decode the payload)
		2. Potential for forgery (if the "none" algorithm is supported)
			3. cracking (guess the "secret" if 1 & 2 didn't work)

- HMAC is only as secure as the secret
- JWT is self-contained
- Sample code uses bad examples
	- we are all lazy
- Guesses all day long on your own system

		Longer list, less focused
			guessing is cheap

SUPER IMPORTANT
IN THE JWT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE A DOT BEFORE THE FUCKING EMPTY SIGNATURE

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
