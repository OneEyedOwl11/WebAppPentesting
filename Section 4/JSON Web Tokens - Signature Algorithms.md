"alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for [[JSON Web Tokens]]

alg, Digital Signature, Implementation Requirements
HS256, HMAC using SHA-256, Required
RS256, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256, Recommended
none, no Digital signature or MAC performed, Optional

Using the algorithm "none"

JWS's May also be created that do not provide integrity protection. Such a JWS is called an Unsecured JWS. An Unsecured JWS uses the "alg" value "none" and is formatted identically to other JWS's, but must use the **Empty octet(byte) sequence as its JWS signature value**

Recipients MUST verify that the JWS Signature value is the empty octet sequence

Implementation Requirements 

All alg's are required
