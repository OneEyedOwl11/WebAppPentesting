Illustrate, Don't Decorate (Use goddamn screenshots)

Good Screenshots
	- Helpful & Clear

Screenshot decisions
- Entire Browser window 
- Plain Screenshot
- Text too small to read
- text too large to ignore
- Just the viewport
- Crop to important part
- something to direct attention
- relevant text in image about the same size as body text around it
- [[URL's]] Always next to it
- Try not to use colours that affect colour-blind people

Explain clearly to "yourself, two years ago"
Make it obvious how to reproduce the behaviour
	include prerequisites
	Include "breadcrumbs" or similar as needed
Stick to the facts
	Don't blame. Not even passively

Never say You "Just" need to fix this. Because the reason that there's a problem is usually not because the other person is stupid.
