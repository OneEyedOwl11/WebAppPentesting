A lot to practice in one small thing.

![[Pasted image 20241002163251.png]]

It is input. Even though not all input looks like Input

"A conpact URL-safe means of representing claims(information) to transmit between two parties"

The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted

# JSON Web token contains

```
JOSE Header: {"typ":"JWT", "alg":"HS256"}
Payload:    {
	"iss":"U. of Bonn",
	"sub":"Weierstra√ü",
	"exp":1615748971358,
	"role":"instructor"
}
```

Base64url encoded, concatinated, signed...
base64url(header)
	.
		base64url(payload)
			.
				base64url(signature)

Convert Base64 string to a Base64URL string...

\+ becomes -
/ becomes __ 
= becomes nothing(padding is removed)


# Base64 of JWT often begins with eyJ0eXAi or eyJhbGci

```
$ echo -n 'eyJ0eXAi' | base64 -d

{"typ"
$ echo -n '{"alg"' | base64

eyJhbGci
```
... and a dot in the first 40 - 60 characters or so ...

base64 does not protect information from malice. It only makes it url -safe


Header says two main things
1. this is a JWT
2. The signature was computed with *this* algorithm
