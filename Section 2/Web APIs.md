REST APIs
	parameters in the URLs path
POST data is not in query string format
	that's the difference

APIs are designed for non-browser clients
	can't learn by just clicking around
Browser complexity is gone
	no parser, no renderer, no JS engine
	no automatic cookie submition
Browser Safeguards is gone
	No same-origin policy
	no reliable "Origin" Header
XSS not possible in Web APIs

Figuring out what it's supposed to do is harder
Figuring out what it actually does is the same

Common issues:
- Authentication and Authorization
- IDOR
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Information Disclosure
- Same as webapps but no browser
	-  Focus on FUNDAMENTALS
