bypassing a redirect [[Filters]]
After learning about filters you can now go check all the redirects on the site and change one of them to something that you would like to change it to. 

However there a filters stopping you from doing so. Now you have to see where you can edit the [[URL's]] to bypass the filter.

We can see that changing the actual URL does not work. However changing the start or the end allows you to change the link as long as the original remans untouched.

with that knowledge you can try and edit the link to your liking. But how do we maintain the original link intact and also direct our victim to the link that we want them to go to

well there are several ways:

You can have the link be a search parameter of another link e.g.
	/redirect?to=\http://example.com/search?q=\https://thelinkyourvictimactuallywanted.com

You can also make the link into a array depending on how the server handles it as there is nothing in the RFC that tells servers how to handle this
	/redirect?to=\http://examplesite.com&to\https://thelinkyourvictimactuallywanted.com

Lastly you can also add html tags to the link. still keeping it intact
	/redirect?to=\http://examplesite.com\<script>\https://thelinkyourvictimactuallywanted.com\</script>
