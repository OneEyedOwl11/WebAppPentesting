2 Jobs:
Block: 
- Black list
- Block list
- Deny lost
Allow:
- White list
- Allow list

Literal match
A list of all items of interest
eg all 50 states + washington, DC
	Good place for allow list
		DC, MN,ND...

Bad place for a block list
	- 26^2 = 676 - 51 = 625 items
	- AA,AB,AC and aa,ab,ac
	- then you have to block numbers, signs

- a list of all items of interes
- allow any valid product
- deny discontinued products
	- but this would not be on the allow list anyway?
- allow any valid coupon
- deny expired coupon
	- but it is not on valid coupon list anyway?

Range Match
- indicate a start and end
- allow any month 1-12
- what about 0 and 13 and negative
- allow any IP on the 10.10.10.0/24
- deny any IP starting with 10.10.10
	- What about 10.10.101.10???

Regular expression matches
- A pattern that matches all items of interest
- uses literals, metacharacters, character classes, etc
	Patterns for matching against
	- any character that matches itself
		- ```meow``` matches a string that contains meow, like ```homeowner```
	-  A dot is a metacharacter that matches any character
		- ```ho.se``` matches ```house``` but not ```hose```
	- a caret anchors the pattern to the start of the string
		- ```^ban``` matches ```banana``` and ```bandana``` but not ```abandon```
	- A dollar anchors the patter to the end of a string
		- ```can$``` matches ```pelican``` and ```can``` but not ```cannot```

- Character classes in Regex
	- \\\\d means "any digit" and \\D means "any non-digit"
	- \\\[0-9] is the same as \\d and \[^0-9] is the same as \\D
	- \\\\s means "whitespace" and \\S means "non-whitespace"
	- different parsers define "whitespace" differently
	- + means "One or more of the preceding"
	- \\* means "zero or more of the preceding" (including the empty string!)
	- \\\\ before a character means "treat this next one as literal: ignore it's special meaning"
		- E.g. \\+ matches a literal + and \\. matches a literal dot. \\\\ matches a literal backslash
