Integers may be the most obvious
Dates
Usernames
Email Addresses
Filenames
GUIDs
Hash of a filename

IDOR (heading) 
Any "reference" that points to a non-public thing
Where if you supply the reference you get the thing

Not all "direct object references" are "insecure"
Using a hard-to-guess reference (e.g. a GUID instead of a small integer)
	Can work, if the identifier is treated as a secret (see also: session cookies)
	But usually does not address root of the problem
make sure user does not have access to the thing in order to change it and use it to benefit themselves
