A rule that is enforced on the client

on the client ```==``` in the browser

Usability
Save time: validate the form before submitting
Help users avoid predictable errors:
- Don't let them submit an incomplete form
- Don't let them type 100 characters in a 32 character field
- make sure phone number has enough digits and no letters
- etc

Security
User always controls the client
A browser is just one possible client
Hostile (and bored or curious) users can easily bypass them
