A rule that is enforced on the client

on the client ```==``` in the browser
eg 
- Input Field lengths
- Disabled form Field
- Multi-Step sequences (shopping checkout, Can't get to step 3 without being on step 2)

Usability
Save time: validate the form before submitting
Help users avoid predictable errors:
- Don't let them submit an incomplete form
- Don't let them type 100 characters in a 32 character field
- make sure phone number has enough digits and no letters
- etc

This can be done with a combination of [[HTML]] and [[JAVASCRIPT]]

Security
User always controls the client
A browser is just one possible client
Hostile (and bored or curious) users can easily bypass them

What you see is not all there is
Don't only focus on what you can see, this leads to blind spots

The server should be a controlled environment
The client is not

Burp does not disable javascript validation that runs on client but JS that comes from the server
