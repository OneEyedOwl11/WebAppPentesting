Proving of your identity
How do you keep your identity after every click without re-authenticating.
Cookies help you do this (traditionally). 
Whenever you click on anything the server requests the cookie or DOM Storage for you to prove your identity and keep your session.
[[Storage]] also does this. Stored data in your browser helps the server realize who you are (not specifically a cookie)

Cookies are obvious
	They appear in HTTP headers as "Set-Cookie" RFC 6265
		can also be set by client-side scripts
	Cookie Header:

HTTP knows nothing about local [[Storage]]
